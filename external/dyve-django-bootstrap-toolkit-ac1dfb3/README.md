History
-------

When building my first Django project with Bootstrap I went looking for available open source applications that connected Django and Bootstrap.

I found  https://github.com/tzangms/django-bootstrap-form. The approach to template tags and filters seemed right, but Bootstrap does so much more than just forms.

This is how `django-bootstrap-toolkit` started. I used ideas from other Django apps. The code was started from scratch.
