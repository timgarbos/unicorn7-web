The game can be played on any computer without any special equipment. The goal was to expand the game experience to as many players as possible without having the players to use the keyboard or any special hardware. The game should be easily accessible and so it is. The game mechanic and the player input is sound. A lot of sound. Hence the name of the game. Basically the game is about yelling as loud as possible when you colour lights up.", "pub_date": "2012-10-14T17:29:13Z", "users": [1]}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "games.game", "fields": {"video_link": "http://www.copenhagengamecollective.org/projects/photonboy/", "title": "Photonboy", "short_credits": "Lasse Jon Fuglsang Pedersen, Tim Garbos and Peter Bruun-Rasmussen (audio programming)", "playable_link": "http://qeep.dk/~volmer/exile/photonboy.zip", "download_link": "http://qeep.dk/~volmer/exile/photonboy.zip", "short_description": "hotonboy is an abstract game where you as the player undertake the quest of photonboy.

The idiots have found out, that while the elite group is smaller in numbers, they still have control over the general population with intricate use of their power of intelligence to rule over the Idiots. The Idiots realizing that they have been mind controlled by a small group of elites, revolt and fight, to take back the power, and try to overthrow the Brains. But they are subject to the whims of the Brains, who lays down the laws and decides how everything is run. (inspired by \u201cThe Marching Morons\u201d by Cyril M.

The Brain\u2019s objective is to survive by killing the Idiots with mind control \u2013 the player must concentrate, truly, to charge a weapon in order to shoot and kill one Idiot. This takes a couple of seconds, while the Idiots try to catch the Brain and ruin its concentration!\r\n\r\nThe Brain\u2019s powers hinder the Idiots\u2019 movement, so they are unusually sluggish creatures. This is because concentrated brain waves confuse the Idiots motive abilities, causing them to explode from confusion if they try to move too fast. However, if the Brain loses its concentration, the Idiots can move faster and converge on the Brain to catch it and steal its power.\r\n\r\nIf the Brain kills all Idiots, the Brain wins. If an Idiot catches the Brain (and devours the brain), the Idiots win.\r\nNow that Idiot is the Brain and it all starts again!", "pub_date": "2012-10-14T17:32:44Z", "users": [1]}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "games.game", "fields": {"video_link": "http://www.copenhagengamecollective.org/projects/flot/", "title": "FLOT!", "short_credits": "Game development: Patrick Jarnfelt, Sound: Anders Monrad, Anders Boerup, Graphics/Producer: Simon Nielsen", "playable_link": "http://www.copenhagengamecollective.org/projects/flot/", "download_link": "http://www.copenhagengamecollective.org/projects/flot/", "short_description": "Flot! is a purely auditory physical game.

The challenge for the second player, then, is to explore the soundscape using his body and match the sound and pose by ear only.\r\n\r\nThe players progress through various levels that all have different mapping of audio to the players\u2019 motion and poses.
